    ABSTRACT = {Entropy is a measure of uncertainty or randomness. It is the foundation for almost all cryptographic systems. True random number generators (TRNGs) and physical unclonable functions (PUFs) are the silicon primitives to respectively harvest dynamic and static entropy to generate random bit streams. In this survey paper, we present a systematic and comprehensive review of different state-of-the-art methods to harvest entropy from silicon-based devices, including the implementations, applications, and the security of the designs. Furthermore, we conclude the trends of the entropy source design to point out the current spots of entropy harvesting.},
